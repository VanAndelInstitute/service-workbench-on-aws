 <!-- This template is for services that receive findings from Security Hub.-->
 <!-- To complete the information, you need to obtain the following information -->
 <!-- from the service team: -->
 <!-- * Whether your service has additional configuration associated with the integration -->
<!--* The mechanism used to receive findings from Security Hub. -->
 <!--* The types of findings that your service receives from Security Hub.-->
<!--* How long from when a finding is created in Security Hub until it is visible in your service.-->
<!--* The mechanism that your service uses to retry receiving findings if there is a system outage.-->
<!--* How users can view and use findings from Security Hub in your service.-->

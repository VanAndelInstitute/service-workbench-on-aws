 <para>Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of
  &SERVICENAME; and your other &AWS; solutions. &AWS; provides the following monitoring tools to
  watch &SERVICENAME;, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when
  appropriate:</para>
 <!-- WRITER INSTRUCTIONS: Add or remove items from this list as appropriate. -->
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para><emphasis>&CWlong;</emphasis> monitors your &AWS; resources and the applications you run on &AWS; in real
    time. You can collect and track metrics, create customized dashboards, and set alarms that notify you or take
    actions when a specified metric reaches a threshold that you specify. For example, you can have &CW; track CPU usage
    or other metrics of your &EC2; instances and automatically launch new instances when needed. For more information,
    see the &link-cw-user;.</para>
  </listitem>
    <listitem>
   <para><emphasis>&CWLlong;</emphasis> enables you to monitor, store, and access your log files from &EC2; instances,
    &CT;, and other sources. &CWL; can monitor information in the log files and notify you when certain thresholds are
    met. You can also archive your log data in highly durable storage. For more information, see the
    &link-cwl-user;.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para><emphasis>&CTlong;</emphasis> captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your &AWS-account;
    and delivers the log files to an &S3; bucket that you specify. You can identify which users and accounts called
    &AWS;, the source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred. For more information, see
    the &link-ct-user;.</para>
   
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 
  <para><emphasis>&EVlong;</emphasis> is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect your 
   applications with data from a variety of sources. &EV; delivers a stream of real-time data from your 
   own applications, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and &AWS; services and routes that
   data to targets such as &LAM;. This enables you to monitor events that happen in services, and build
  event-driven architectures. For more information, see the &link-ev-user;.</para>

   <titleabbrev>Monitoring with &CW;</titleabbrev>
  </info>
  <para>You can monitor &SERVICENAME; using &CW;, which collects raw data and processes it
   into readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics are kept for 15 months, so that you can access historical
   information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing. You can also set
   alarms that watch for certain thresholds, and send notifications or take actions when those thresholds are met. For
   more information, see the &link-cw-user;.</para>
  <!-- WRITER INSTRUCTIONS: The following paragraph is just a suggestion. Feel free to omit it
        if there are no particular metrics or situations you want to point your customers to.-->
  <para>For &SERVICENAME;, you might want to watch for <replaceable>XXX</replaceable>, and
   also watch <replaceable>XXX</replaceable> and <replaceable>Take Automatic Action</replaceable> when <replaceable>This
    Happens</replaceable>.</para>
  <para>The &SERVICENAME; service reports the following metrics 
   in the <code>AWS/MyServiceName</code> namespace.</para>
  <!-- WRITER INSTRUCTIONS: List your metrics and dimensions in tables here.  Do not put them in the AWSCloudWatchMetricsShared
  package, that package has been deprecated.  Be sure to mention the name of the metrics namespace where your service's metrics 
  will be stored.  When your new metrics section is published, contact the CloudWatch writer so that they
  can add a link to your metrics section from a centralized page in the CloudWatch User Guide
  
  These example tables include 1 entry each from actual tables to help you get started. You may not have "Valid Statistic" entries for
  some of your metrics, but it is good to check with your service team, as some possible CloudWatch statistics
  might not be useful for a particular metric.-->

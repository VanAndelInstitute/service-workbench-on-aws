<!--GUIDELINES
1. See the RAM Onboarding Wiki https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWSDocs/RAM-onboarding/
2. Enter your resource name and service name in the entities above and copy the entities to your local entities file for your package.
3. Read the comments carefully. Feel free to remove comments after you have addressed them.
4. "owner" = the account that owns the resource and shares it. "consumer" = the account with which the resource is shared.
5. Add in any additional sections that might be specific to your service.
6. After you have completed your topic, do a text search for "TBD" to ensure that you haven't missed anything.
7. For examples, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/capacity-reservation-sharing.html AND https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html-->

		<para>To ensure that resources are distributed across the Availability Zones for a Region, we independently map 
			Availability Zones to names for each account. This could lead to Availability Zone naming differences
			across accounts. For example, the Availability Zone <code>us-east-1a</code> for your &AWS-account; 
			might not have the same location as <code>us-east-1a</code> for another &AWS-account;.</para>			
		
		<para>To identify the location of your &RESOURCE; relative to your accounts, you must use the
			<emphasis>Availability Zone ID</emphasis> (AZ ID). The AZ ID is a unique and consistent identifier for an 
			Availability Zone across all &AWS-accounts;. For example, <code>use1-az1</code> is an AZ ID for the 
			<code>us-east-1</code> Region and it is the same location in every &AWS-account;.</para>

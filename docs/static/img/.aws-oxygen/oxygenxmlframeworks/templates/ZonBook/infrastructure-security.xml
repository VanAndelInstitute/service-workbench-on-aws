   <para>As a managed service, &SERVICENAMElong; is protected by the &AWS; global network security
      procedures that are described in the <ulink
         url="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf">&AWSlong;: Overview of Security Processes</ulink> whitepaper.</para>
   <para>You use &AWS; published API calls to access &SERVICENAME; through the network. Clients must
      support Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 or later. We recommend TLS 1.2 or later. Clients
      must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral
      Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems
      such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</para> 
   
      <para>Additionally, requests must be signed by using
      an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an &IAM; principal. Or you
      can use the <ulink type="documentation" url="STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">&STSlong;</ulink> (&STS;) to generate
      temporary security credentials to sign requests.</para>
   <!--TODO: Does your service support resource-based access policies, which can include restrictions based on the source IP address? If yes, add the following-->
   <!--Ideally, add an example. For example, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies-vpc-endpoint.html. -->
   <!--
    <para>You can call these API operations from any network location, but &SERVICENAME; does support resource-based access policies, which can include restrictions based on the source IP address. You can also use &SERVICENAME; policies to control access from specific Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoints or specific VPCs. Effectively, this isolates network access to a given &SERVICENAME; resource from only the specific VPC within the &AWS; network.</para>

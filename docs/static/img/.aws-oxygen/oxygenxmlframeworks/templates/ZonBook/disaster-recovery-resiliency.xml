    <para>The &AWS; global infrastructure is built around &AWS-Regions; and Availability Zones. &AWS-Regions; provide multiple physically separated and isolated
        Availability Zones, which are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With Availability Zones, you can design and
        operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between zones without interruption. Availability Zones are more highly
        available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures. </para>
 
    <!-- REMOVING THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE UNTIL LOCAL REGIONS ARE MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE-->
    <!--
    <para>If you need to replicate your data or applications over greater geographic distances, use
        &AWS; Local Regions. An &AWS; Local Region is a single data center designed to complement an
        existing &AWS; Region. Like all &AWS-Regions;, &AWS; Local Regions are completely isolated
        from other &AWS-Regions;.</para>
        -->

  <para>&SERVICElong; is integrated with &CTlong;, a service that provides a record of actions 
    taken by a user, role, or an &AWS; service in &SERVICE;. &CT; captures all API calls for
    &SERVICE; as events. The calls captured include calls from the &SERVICE; console and
    code calls to the &SERVICE; API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable
    continuous delivery of &CT; events to an &S3; bucket, including events for &SERVICE;. If 
    you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the &CT; console 
    in <guilabel>Event history</guilabel>.  Using the information collected by &CT;, you can
    determine the request that was made to &SERVICE;, the IP address from which the request
    was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details.</para>

    <para>&CT; is enabled on your &AWS-account; when you create the account. When activity occurs 
      in &SERVICE;, that activity is recorded in a &CT; event along with other &AWS; service events
      in <guilabel>Event history</guilabel>. You can view, search, and download recent events in 
      your &AWS-account;. For more information, see <ulink

        history</ulink>.</para>
    
    <para>For an ongoing record of events in your &AWS-account;, including events for &SERVICE;,
      create a trail. A <emphasis>trail</emphasis> enables &CT; to deliver log files to an &S3; bucket. 
      By default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to all &AWS-Regions;. The trail 
      logs events from all Regions in the &AWS; partition and delivers the log files to the &S3; bucket 
      that you specify. Additionally, you can configure other &AWS; services to further analyze and act
      upon the event data collected in &CT; logs. For more information, see the following:</para>

    <para>All &SERVICE; actions are logged by &CT; and are documented in the &link-service-api;. For example, 
      calls to the <!-- TODO: Replace ACTION_1, ACTION_2, and ACTION_3 with actual actions from your documentation -->
      <code>ACTION_1</code>, <code>ACTION_2</code> and <code>ACTION_3</code> actions generate
      entries in the &CT; log files.</para>
    <para>Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the request. The

    <para>A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events as log files to an &S3; bucket
      that you specify. &CT; log files contain one or more log entries. An event represents a single
      request from any source and includes information about the requested action, the date and time
      of the action, request parameters, and so on. &CT; log files aren't an ordered stack trace of
      the public API calls, so they don't appear in any specific order. </para>
    <para>The following example shows a &CT; log entry that demonstrates the <!--TODO: Add an action name here, or provide multiple actions. 
      <code>ActionNameHere</code>--> action.</para>
    <programlisting language="json">
      <!-- 
       TODO: Provide one or more examples here, agreeing with the action or actions you specified in the preceding paragraph.
       Make sure that you use example access keys, safe fictitious names and IP addreses, etc. in your examples.

 <para>&EV; enables you to automate your &AWS; services and respond automatically to system events such as
  application availability issues or resource changes. Events from &AWS; services are delivered to &EV; in near real
  time. You can write simple rules to indicate which events are of interest to you, and what automated actions to take
  when an event matches a rule. The actions that can be automatically triggered include the following:</para>

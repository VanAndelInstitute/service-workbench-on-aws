This template is for services that integrate with CloudFormation (CFN). For information about integrating your service with CloudFormation, see     https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWSDocs/testing-and-publishing/add-cross-service-content/CloudFormation_integration
 
Template instructions: 

     0. Save this template to your user guide package as cloudformation-yourservicename.xml.
        If you choose to insert this topic beneath an existing chapter or section in your documentation, make sure         to change the preceding "chapter" tag to "section".
     
     1. Replace the values for the entities at the top of this file with your service names (short and long),              resource type (plural), and link to your service's top-node landing page in the CFN Resource and property          types reference                                                                                                    (example: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_AccessAnalyzer.html). 
        Then paste these entities into your already-existing entities file.
     
     2. Review the content in comments. If it applies to your service, remove the comment markers and revise the           content so it's appropriate for your service.

 <para>&SERVICElong; is integrated with &CFNlong;, a service that helps you to model and set up your
  &AWS; resources so that you can spend less time creating and managing your resources and
  infrastructure. You create a template that describes all the &AWS; resources that you want (such as
  &resources;), and &CFN; provisions and configures those resources for
  you. </para>
 <para>When you use &CFN;, you can reuse your template to set up your &SERVICE; resources
  consistently and repeatedly. Describe your resources once, and then provision the same
  resources over and over in multiple &AWS-accounts; and Regions. </para>

  <para>To provision and configure resources for &SERVICE; and related services, you must
   understand <ulink type="documentation"

   are formatted text files in JSON or YAML. These templates describe the resources that you want to
   provision in your &CFN; stacks. If you're unfamiliar with JSON or YAML, you can use &CFN;
   Designer to help you get started with &CFN; templates. For more information, see <ulink

            <para>By default, when you send messages to recipients in India, &SERVICENAME; uses International
                Long Distance Operator (ILDO) connections to transmit those messages. When recipients
                see a message that&apos;s sent over an ILDO connection, it appears to be sent from a random
                numeric ID. Choosing a route type (transactional or promotional) is mandatory when sending 
                domestic messages to India. For a promotional message, choose the 
                promotional route type as this uses a numeric sender ID. For a transactional message, 
                choose the transactional route as this uses a case-sensitive alphanumeric sender ID. 
                Note that your account cannot use both numeric sender IDs and alphanumeic sender IDs 
                in the same account. Maintain separate accounts for each ID type. For additional content 
                guidelines, see the <ulink url="https://www.vilpower.in">Vilpower website</ulink>.</para>
                      
            <para>If you prefer to use an alphabetic sender ID for your SMS messages, you have to send
                those messages over local routes rather than ILDO routes. To send messages using local
                routes, you must first register your use case and message templates with the Telecom
                Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) through Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) portals. 
                These registration requirements are designed to reduce the number of unsolicited 
                messages that Indian consumers receive, and to protect consumers from potentially 
                harmful messages. This registration process is managed by Vodafone India through 
                its Vilpower service.</para>
            
            <!-- Here are the pricing links. Copy and paste the link for your service over the

                    &PRICINGPAGE;
                    page. The price for sending messages using ILDO connections is higher than the
                    price for sending messages through local routes.</para>

# AWS SDK for Ruby code examples for AWS CloudTrail

## Purpose
This folder contains code examples that demonstrate how to use the AWS SDK for Ruby to automate AWS CloudTrail.

CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing 
of your AWS account. Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail.

## Code examples

### API examples
- [Create a trail](./aws-ruby-sdk-cloudtrail-example-create-trail.rb)
- [Delete a trail](./aws-ruby-sdk-cloudtrail-example-delete-trail.rb)
- [Describe trails](./aws-ruby-sdk-cloudtrail-example-describe-trails.rb)
- [Lookup events](./aws-ruby-sdk-cloudtrail-example-lookup-events.rb)

## Important

- As an AWS best practice, grant this code least privilege, or only the 
  permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see 
  [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) 
  in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are 
  available only in specific AWS Regions. For more information, see the 
  [AWS Regional Services List](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
  on the AWS website.
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account. To create an account, see [How do I create and activate a new AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) on the AWS Premium Support website.
- AWS credentials or an AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) access token. For details, see 
  [Configuring the AWS SDK for Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/setup-config.html) in the 
  *AWS SDK for Ruby Developer Guide*.
- To run the code examples, Ruby version 1.9 or later. For Ruby download and installation instructions, see 
  [Download Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) on the Ruby Progamming Language website.
- To test the code examples, RSpec 3.9 or later. For RSpec download and installation instructions, see the [rspec/rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) repository in GitHub.
- The AWS SDK for Ruby. For AWS SDK for Ruby download and installation instructions, see 
  [Install the AWS SDK for Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/setup-install.html) in the 
  *AWS SDK for Ruby Developer Guide*.

Most of these code example files can be run with very little to no modification. For example, to use Ruby
to run the `aws-ruby-sdk-cloudtrail-example-create-trail.rb` file, replace the hard-coded values in the file 
with your own values, save the file, and then run the file. For example:

```
ruby aws-ruby-sdk-cloudtrail-example-create-trail.rb
```

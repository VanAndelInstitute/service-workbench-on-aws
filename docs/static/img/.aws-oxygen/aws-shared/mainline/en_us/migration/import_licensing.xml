    <para>When you create a new replication job, the &SMSlong; console provides a <guilabel>License
            type</guilabel> option. The possible values include:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para><guilabel>Auto</guilabel> (default)</para>
            <para>Detects the source-system operating system (OS) and applies the appropriate
                license to the migrated virtual machine (VM).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><guilabel>AWS</guilabel></para>
            <para>Replaces the source-system license with an AWS license, if appropriate, on the
                migrated VM.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><guilabel>BYOL</guilabel></para>
            <para>Retains the source-system license, if appropriate, on the migrated VM.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <note>
        <para>If you choose a license type that is incompatible with your VM, the replication job
            fails with an error message. For more information, see the OS-specific information
            below.</para>
    </note>
    <para>The same licensing options are available through the &SMS; API and CLI. For
        example:</para>
    <programlisting><userinput>aws sms create-replication-job --license-type <replaceable>&lt;value></replaceable></userinput></programlisting>
    <para>The value of the <code>--license-type</code> parameter can be AWS or BYOL. Leaving it
        unset is the same as choosing <guilabel>Auto</guilabel> in the console. </para>

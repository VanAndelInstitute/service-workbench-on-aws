 <para>You can use notification rules to notify users when there are changes to deployment
  applications, such as deployment successes and failures. Notification rules specify both the
  events and the &SNS; topic that is used to send notifications. For more information, see <ulink

   <para>On the application page, choose <guilabel>Notify</guilabel>, and then choose

  <step>
   <para>In <guilabel>Notification name</guilabel>, enter a name for the rule.</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>In <guilabel>Detail type</guilabel>, choose <guilabel>Basic</guilabel> if you want only the
    information provided to &EVlong; included in the notification. Choose <guilabel>Full</guilabel>

   <para> In <guilabel>Events that trigger notifications</guilabel>, select the events for which you

   <para>In <guilabel>Targets</guilabel>, do one of the following:</para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>If you have already configured a resource to use with notifications, in <guilabel>Choose
       target type</guilabel>, choose either <guilabel>&CHAT; (Slack)</guilabel> or <guilabel>SNS
       topic</guilabel>. In <guilabel>Choose target</guilabel>, choose the name of the client (for a
      Slack client configured in &CHAT;) or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the &SNS; topic (for
      &SNS; topics already configured with the policy required for notifications).</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>If you have not configured a resource to use with notifications, choose <guilabel>Create

       <guilabel>Create</guilabel>.</para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <note>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>If you create the &SNS; topic as part of creating the notification rule, the policy that
       allows the notifications feature to publish events to the topic is applied for you. Using a
       topic created for notification rules helps ensure that you subscribe only those users that
       you want to receive notifications about this resource.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>You cannot create an &CHAT; client as part of creating a notification rule. If you
       choose &CHAT; (Slack), you will see a button directing you to configure a client in &CHAT;.
       Choosing that option opens the &CHAT; console. For more information, see <ulink

        Integrations Between Notifications and &CHAT;</ulink>.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>If you want to use an existing &SNS; topic as a target, you must add the required policy
       for &ACN; in addition to any other policies that might exist for that topic. For more
       information, see <ulink type="documentation"
        url="codestar-notifications/latest/userguide/set-up-sns.html">Configure Amazon SNS Topics

  <step>
   <para>To finish creating the rule, choose <guilabel>Submit</guilabel>.</para>

   <para>You must subscribe users to the &SNS; topic for the rule before they can receive
    notifications. For more information, see <ulink url="&url-acn-ug;subscribe-users-sns.html"
     >Subscribe Users to &SNS; Topics That Are Targets</ulink>. You can also set up integration
    between notifications and &CHAT; to send notifications to &CHM; chatrooms or Slack channels. For

 <procedure id="notification-rule-create-cli">
  <info>
   <title id="notification-rule-create-cli.title">To create a notification rule (&CLI;)</title>
  </info>
  <step>
   <para>At a terminal or command prompt, run the <command>create-notification rule</command>
    command to generate the JSON skeleton:</para>
   <programlisting>aws codestar-notifications create-notification-rule --generate-cli-skeleton > <replaceable>rule.json</replaceable></programlisting>
   <para>You can name the file anything you want. In this example, the file is named
     <replaceable>rule.json</replaceable>.</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Open the JSON file in a plain-text editor and edit it to include the resource, event types,
    and target you want for the rule. The following example shows a notification rule named
     <userinput>MyNotificationRule</userinput> for an application named
     <replaceable>MyDeploymentApplication</replaceable> in an &AWS; acccount with the ID
     <replaceable>&ExampleAWSAccountNo3;</replaceable>. Notifications are sent with the full detail
    type to an &SNS; topic named
     <replaceable>codestar-notifications-MyNotificationTopic</replaceable> when deployments are
    successful:</para>
   <programlisting>{
    "Name": "<replaceable>MyNotificationRule</replaceable>",

        }
    ],
    "Status": "ENABLED",
    "DetailType": "FULL"
}</programlisting>
   <para>Save the file.</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Using the file you just edited, at the terminal or command line, run the
     <command>create-notification-rule</command> command again to create the notification
    rule:</para>
   <programlisting>aws codestar-notifications create-notification-rule --cli-input-json  file://<replaceable>rule.json</replaceable></programlisting>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>If successful, the command returns the ARN of the notification rule, similar to the
    following:</para>
   <programlisting>{
    "Arn": "arn:aws:codestar-notifications:<replaceable>us-east-1</replaceable>:<replaceable>&ExampleAWSAccountNo3;</replaceable>:notificationrule/dc82df7a-EXAMPLE"

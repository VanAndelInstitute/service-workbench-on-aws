  </abstract>
 </info>
 <para>&SERVICENAME; is integrated with &CFNlong;, a service that helps you model and set up your
  &AWS; resources so that you can spend less time creating and managing your resources and
  infrastructure. You create a template that describes all the &AWS; resources that you want (like
  &RESOURCENAMEPLURAL;), and &CFN; takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for
  you. </para>
 <para>When you use &CFN;, you can reuse your template to set up your &SERVICENAME; resources
  consistently and repeatedly. Just describe your resources once, and then provision the same
  resources over and over in multiple &AWS; accounts and Regions. </para>

  <para>To provision and configure resources for &SERVICENAME; and related services, you must
   understand <ulink type="documentation"
    url="AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-guide.html">&CFN; templates</ulink>. Templates
   are formatted text files in JSON or YAML. These templates describe the resources that you want to
   provision in your &CFN; stacks. If you're unfamiliar with JSON or YAML, you can use &CFN;
   Designer to help you get started with &CFN; templates. For more information, see <ulink
    type="documentation"
    url="AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/working-with-templates-cfn-designer.html">What is &CFN;
    Designer?</ulink> in the <emphasis>&guide-cfn-user;</emphasis>.</para>
  <para>&SERVICENAME; supports creating &RESOURCENAMEPLURAL;
   <!-- and list any additional resources for your service, if your service has multiple resource types supported in 
  CloudFormation -->
   in &CFN;. For more information, including examples of JSON and YAML templates for
   &RESOURCENAMEPLURAL;, see &RESOURCETEMPLATEURL; in the
   <emphasis>&guide-cfn-user;</emphasis>.</para>
  <!-- You can also create templates that
   create related resources, such as <replaceable>related-resource-1</replaceable> and <replaceable>related-resource-2</replaceable>. -->

 <!-- Bonus points: Add another section that covers a particularly interesting use case for your service and CloudFormation, including example templates. -->

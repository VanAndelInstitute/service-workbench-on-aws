    <para>&fps_product_short; provides a seamless integration with web sites optimized for mobile devices. No special &fps_product_short; coding is 
    required. The software detects the client browser HTTP_USER_AGENT and routes the request along the appropriate CBUI pipeline. A separate pipeline is 
    optimized for the mobile device experience.</para>
    <note><para>For optimal security, your mobile application should make use of a full browser instance (not a browser embedded within an 
    application). It should display the browser address bar to enable customers to confirm the URL.</para></note>
    <para>The user CBUI experience is managed for you. You handle all &fps_product_short; requests, return URLs, and IPN notifications regardless 
    of which client browser the customer is using.</para>
 <para condition="fps-acc;fps-adv;fps-agg;fps-bas;fps-dig;fps-mkt;asp-adv"><phrase condition="fps">&fps_product_short;</phrase><phrase condition="asp">&asp_product;</phrase> makes it easy to test your mobile client experience. For more information, see

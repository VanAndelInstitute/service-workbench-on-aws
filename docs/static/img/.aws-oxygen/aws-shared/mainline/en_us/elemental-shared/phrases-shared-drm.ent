 <!ENTITY  encryption-resource-id '<para>For <guilabel>Resource ID</guilabel>, enter an identifier for the content. The service sends this to the key server to identify the current
            endpoint. How unique you make this depends on how fine-grained you want access
            controls to be. The service
            does not allow you to use the same ID for two simultaneous encryption processes. The resource ID is also known as the content ID. </para>
          <para>The following example shows a resource ID.</para>

<!ENTITY  encryption-system-ids '<para>For <guilabel>System IDs</guilabel>, enter unique identifiers for your streaming protocol and DRM system. Provide up to two IDs for
       DASH and exactly one for the other streaming protocols. If you provide more than one system
       ID, enter them on separate lines, and do not separate them with commas or any other
       punctuation. For a list of common system IDs, see <ulink url="https://dashif.org/identifiers/content_protection/">DASH-IF System IDs</ulink>. If you do not know your IDs, ask your DRM solution provider.</para> ' >
<!ENTITY  encryption-url '<para>For <guilabel>URL</guilabel>, enter the URL of the API Gateway proxy that you set up to talk to your key server. The API Gateway proxy must reside in the same &AWS-Region; as &servicename;.</para>
            <para>The following example shows a URL. </para>
      <programlisting>https://1wm2dx1f33.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/SpekeSample/copyProtection</programlisting> ' >
 <!ENTITY  encryption-role-arn '<para>For <guilabel>Role ARN</guilabel>, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that provides you access to send your requests through API Gateway. Get
            this from your DRM solution provider.</para>
            <para>The following example shows a role ARN. </para>

<!ENTITY  encryption-key-rotation-interval '<para>(Optional) For <guilabel>Key rotation interval</guilabel>, enter the frequency, in seconds, of key changes for live workflows, in which content is
       streamed real time. The service retrieves content keys before the live content begins
       streaming, and then retrieves them as needed over the lifetime of the workflow. By default, key
       rotation is set to 60 seconds, which is equivalent to setting it to <code>60</code>. To disable key rotation, set this interval to <code>0</code> (zero). </para>
       <para>The following example setting causes the service to rotate keys every thirty minutes.</para>

<!ENTITY  encryption-encryption-method '<para>For <guilabel>Encryption method</guilabel>, choose <guilabel>Sample-AES</guilabel> for Apple HLS FairPlay or choose <guilabel>AES-128</guilabel> for Apple HLS AES-128. </para> ' >
 <!ENTITY  encryption-constant-initialization-vector ' <para>(Optional) For <guilabel>Constant initialization vector</guilabel> enter a
                                    128-bit, 16-byte hex value represented by a 32-character string,
                                    to be used with the key for encrypting content.</para> ' >
 <!ENTITY  encryption-certificate-arn "<para>(Optional) For <guilabel>Certificate ARN</guilabel>, enter a 2048 RSA certificate ARN to
 use for content key encryption. Use this option only if your DRM key provider supports content key encryption. If you use this and your
 key provider doesn't support it, the request fails.</para>" >
<!ENTITY  encryption-repeat-ext-x-key '<para>(Optional) Select <guilabel>Repeat EXT-X-KEY</guilabel> if you want the service to repeat the key before every segment of the manifest. By
        default, the key is written just once, after the header and before the segments. If you
        select <guilabel>Repeat EXT-X-KEY</guilabel>, the manifest is written as header, key,
        segment, key, segment, key, and so on, with every segment preceded by the key. Set this
        according to the needs of the player. Selecting this option might result in an increase in client requests to the DRM server.</para> ' >

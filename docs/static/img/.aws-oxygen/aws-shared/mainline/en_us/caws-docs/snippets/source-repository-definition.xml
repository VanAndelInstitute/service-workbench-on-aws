<para>A repository is a fundamental version control object in &CAWS;. It's where you securely store
  code and files for your project, including configuration information for your project. It also
  stores the history of your repository, from the first commit through the latest changes. You can
  share your source repository with other users so you can work together on a project. You can have
  one or many source repositories associated with a project.</para>

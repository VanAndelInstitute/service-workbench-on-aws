    <para>In the side navigation menu, choose <guilabel>Code</guilabel>, and then choose <guilabel>Source repositories</guilabel>.</para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>Choose the name of the repository from the list of source repositories for the project. </para> 
    <tip><para>You can filter the list of repositories by typing part of the repository name in the filter bar.</para></tip>

   <step>
    <para>If you do not have a personal access token (PAT), choose <guilabel>Create token</guilabel>. Copy the token and save it in a secure location. You will use this PAT
     when prompted for a password by your Git client or integrated development environment (IDE).</para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>Choose <guilabel>Clone repository</guilabel>. Copy the clone URL for the repository.</para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>Do one of the following:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>If you are cloning a repository to your local computer, open a terminal or command line and run the <command>git clone</command> command, and paste the
     clone URL after the command. For example:</para>
      <programlisting>git clone &CAWS-example-clone-url;</programlisting>
      <para>When prompted for a password, paste the PAT you saved earlier.</para>
       <note><para>If your operating system provides credential management or you have installed a credential management system, 
      you will only need to provide this PAT once. If not, you might have to provide the PAT for all Git operations to the source repository. 
      As a best practice, make sure that your credential management system securely stores your PAT. Do not manually provide the PAT as part of the clone URL string.</para></note>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>If you are cloning a repository using an IDE, your experience will vary depending on the IDE. Choose the option to clone a Git repository and provide the URL. 
       When prompted for a password, provide the PAT. For more information about how to clone a Git repository using your IDE, see the documentation for the IDE.</para>

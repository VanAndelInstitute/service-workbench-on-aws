<para>In order to support access to &CAWS; resources such as source repositories, &CAWS; supports the creation and management of personal access tokens (PATs).
  Peronal access tokens are used with third-party applications, such as Git and integrated development environments (IDEs), as an application-specific password associated
  with an individual user's &CAWS; account. You can have more than one PAT associated with an individual user. Users can create, manage, and delete their own PATs. More to come...</para>

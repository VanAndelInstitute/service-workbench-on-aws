<para>Project templates create a sample application in your preferred framework and programming
  language. Each template includes the compute resources to deploy your application to your test and
  production endpoints. When you create a project with a template, the console generates project
  management pages and adds collaboration tools such as your issue tracking board and activity
  summaries. Sample application code, repositories, and other cloud resources are provisioned for
  you. You can choose from multiple project templates.</para>

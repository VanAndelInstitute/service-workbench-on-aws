<para>A workflow action cannot run if it targets a resource in &AWS; unless it has the permissions it needs. In the private beta, you must manually
create the &IAM; policy or policies that allow the required actions, and you must associate that policy with a role that &CAWS; can assume when 
running the action.  More to come, including links to example policies for source, build, test, and deploy actions.</para>

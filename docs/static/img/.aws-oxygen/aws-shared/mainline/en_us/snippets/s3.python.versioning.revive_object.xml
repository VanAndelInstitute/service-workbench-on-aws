    Revives a versioned object that was deleted by removing the object's active
    delete marker.
    A versioned object presents as deleted when its latest version is a delete marker.
    By removing the delete marker, we make the previous version the latest version
    and the object then presents as *not* deleted.

    Usage is shown in the usage_demo_single_object function at the end of this module.

	<title id="apns-setup.title">Setting Up iOS Push Notifications</title>
	<para>Push notifications for iOS apps are sent using Apple Push Notification service (APNs). Before
		you can send push notifications to iOS devices, you must create an app ID on the Apple
		Developer portal, and you must create the required certificates.</para>
	<para>This section describes how to use the Apple Developer portal to obtain iOS and APNs
		credentials. These credentials enable you to create an iOS project in &AMHlong; and launch a
		sample app that can receive push notifications.</para>
	<para>You do not need an existing iOS app to complete the steps in this section. After you create
		an iOS project in &AMH;, you can download and launch a working sample app. &AMH;
		automatically provisions the &AWS; resources that your app requires.</para>
